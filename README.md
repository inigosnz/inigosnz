<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Íñigo</h1>
<h3 align="center">Engineer passionate about AI, Big Data & Emerging Technologies</h3>

---

I'm a tech-oriented engineering graduate with a strong interest in how cutting-edge technologies can shape the present and future of industry. I enjoy learning by building — whether it's through collaborative university-industry projects or hands-on experimentation with code, tools, and real-world datasets.

🚀 My academic background in Connected Industrial Engineering focused on the integration of disruptive technologies such as:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Big Data & Data Analytics
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Cybersecurity
- Cloud Computing
- Digital Twin & Smart Systems

📚 This degree emphasized both theory and practice, combining university-led learning with real-world projects in collaboration with external companies — allowing me to explore how these innovations can be applied in practical, scalable, and meaningful ways.

🧠 I’m especially drawn to fields like AI and data science, not just for their technical depth but also for their potential to solve complex challenges. I value a hands-on, exploratory approach to learning and constantly seek opportunities to expand my toolkit.
